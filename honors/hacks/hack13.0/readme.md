# Problem Statement {#problem-statement .unnumbered}

You will use the implementation of your `Airport`{.java} class from a
previous hack to develop several reports that will require you to sort
and search (a subset of) the International Civil Aviation Organization
database for particular airports.

We have provided a source file, `AirportUtils.java`{.text} with several
comparators and methods you need to implement. Details are provided in
the documentation.

The `generateReports()`{.java} takes a list of `Airport`{.java}s and
should produce the following reports which should all be output to the
standard output.

-   To help you troubleshoot, you should print out the list of airports
    in the original order to the standard output.

-   Sort the airports by each of the 8 comparators and print them out (8
    reports total).

-   Search for and print out the airport in the array that is closest
    (via air distance) to Lincoln. Lincoln is located at 40.8507N,
    96.7581W.

-   Search for and print out the airport that is the geographic
    west-east median[^1] of the given airports with respect to
    longitude.

-   Search for an airport located in the city New York (city would be
    `New York`{.text} and the country would be `US`{.text}) and print it
    out if it exists. If no such airport exists, print out an
    appropriate message.

-   Search for an airport whose type is `large_airport`{.text} and print
    it out if it exists. If no such airport exists, print out an
    appropriate message.

# Instructions {#instructions .unnumbered}

-   Hand in both your `Airport.java`{.text} and
    `AirportUtils.java`{.text} source files. You may add any utility
    methods you wish but you must *not* change any of the signatures of
    the required methods.

-   In addition, you must create a `main`{.java} method in your
    `AirportUtils.java`{.text} class that tests your reports with at
    least least 5 airports.

-   You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students before,
    during, and after your scheduled hack session.

-   You may (in fact are encouraged) to define any additional "helper"
    methods that may help you.

-   Include the name(s) of everyone who worked together on this activity
    in your source file's header.

-   Turn in all of your files via webhandin, making sure that it runs
    and executes correctly in the webgrader. Each individual student
    will need to hand in their own copy and will receive their own
    individual grade.

[^1]: With 0-indexed lists, the median is usually the element at index
    `n/2`{.c} when sorted. This relies on truncation to give the middle
    index of odd-sized lists and prefers the "right" element for
    even-sized lists.
