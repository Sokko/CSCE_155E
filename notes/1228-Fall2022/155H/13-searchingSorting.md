## Algorithms, Searching & Sorting
### Fall 2022

# Introduction & Demonstration

* Huge part of Computer Science: data processing
* Fundamental operations: *searching*, *sorting*
* Form the basis or preprocessing step of many algorithms
* Large variety of algorithms have been developed

## Preliminaries

* What does searching mean?
  * What are you searching?: Array?  List? Set? Map?
  * What are the elements you are searching? integer?  double?  char? Airports?  Teams?
  * How are you searching for it?
    * Find a particular element $x$
    * Find the maximum or minimum element
    * Find the median
    * Find all instances of a particular element
    * Student: NUID? Name? GPA?

## Linear Search

* Basic idea: given a collection of elements and a key element $k$, search through the collection and find an element that "matches" $k$
* Start with *pseudocode*: fake code that is not tied to a particular language
  * It doesn't use language-specific notation
  * Makes use of math notation
  * Abstract and general
* Good pseudocode can be translated into any particular programming language
