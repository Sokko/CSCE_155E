## Searching & Sorting
### Fall 2022

## Introduction

* Processing data is a fundamental operation in Computer Science
* Two fundamental operations in processing data are *searching* and *sorting*
* Forms the basis or a preprocessing step for numerous algorithms
* Huge variety of algorithms have been developed

### Algorithms

* An Algorithm: a finite sequence of operations that defines a computational process for solving a problem
* All algorithms must be *correct* and *finite*
* Algorithms != Problems
* We can express an algorithm using *pseudocode*
* There may be more than one correct algorithm to solve a problem
* Given two or more algorithms that are *correct*; you need to then decide which one to use based on its *complexity*  or *efficiency*

## Searching

### Preliminaries

* What does searching mean?
  * What are you searching? Array? Lists, Sets, Maps, etc.
  * What are the elements that you are searching among? Integers? Doubles, chars?  Airport, Team?
  * How are you searching?
    * Student: By Name? NUID?  SSN?  GPA?
    * For a particular element, $x$
    * Maximum or minimum element?  Median?
    * Find all instances of $x$?  The first instance of $x$?  The last instance of $x$?

* Zero: $0$
* Empty Set: $\emptyset$
* Phi: $\phi$
