## Conditionals
### Fall 2022

* Normally programs have a *sequential control flow*: each
  instruction is executed top to bottom, one after the other
* However, more complex problems require *decisions*
* Conditionals are how you can specify that code executes
  under one condition or does not execute at all or
* You can specify that undre some condition one piece of code executes otherwise a different piece of code executes
* `if`-statements, `if-else` statements, `if-else-if` statements
* Conditionals rely on some *logical condition*
* Boolean logic: a staticment that is either true or false

# Basic Syntax

```c
if(<condition>) {
  // if the condition evaluates to true
  // everything in this block of code
  // will execute
  // otherwise, none of this code will
  // execute and normal control flow
  // continues after it
}
```
