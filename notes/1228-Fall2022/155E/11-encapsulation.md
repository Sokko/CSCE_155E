## Encapsulation - Structures
### Fall 2022

## Motivating Exercise

* Given (CSV) data on books, compute various statistics/reports:
  * What is the best book?
  * What is the worst book?
  * What are all books written by Frank Herbert?

## Introduction

* Built-in primitive types `int, double, char` are very limiting: not everything is a number or character
* Real world entities are *composed* of multiple pieces of data
* Encapsulating multiple pieces of data into one "object" or "thing" allows you to deal with that one "thing"
* Solution: encapsulation
  * C: structures
* YOu can define a user-defined type called a `struct` that allows you to collect multiple pieces of data into one logical unit
* Encapsulation is a mechanism that allows you to:
  1. Group pieces of data together into one logical "unit"
  2. Protect that data from the outside world
  3. Group functionality that acts on that data with the data
