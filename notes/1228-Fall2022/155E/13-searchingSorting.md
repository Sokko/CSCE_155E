## Searching & Sorting
### Fall 2022

## Introduction

* Processing data is a fundamental operation in Computer Science
* Two fundamental operations in processing data are *searching* and *sorting*
* Forms the basis or a preprocessing step for numerous algorithms
* Huge variety of algorithms have been developed

### Algorithms

* An Algorithm: a finite sequence of operations that defines a computational process for solving a problem
* All algorithms must be *correct* and *finite*
* Algorithms != Problems
* There may be more than one correct algorithm in which case you have other considerations: efficiency or complexity

## Searching

### Preliminaries

* What does searching mean?
  * what are you searching?  Array?  List, Set, Map, etc.
  * What are the elements you are searching among? integers? doubles? char?, Airports?  Teams?
  * How are you searching?
    * Students: Name?  NUID, SSN, GPA
    * Particular element $x$?
    * Maximum or minimum or median element?
    * Find all instances or the first or the last instance, etc.
