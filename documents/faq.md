## zyBooks

zyBooks is an online, interactive textbook used for this course.  To get
access, you should:

1. Visit your campus book store:
 * UNL: https://www.bkstr.com/Nebraska-lincolnstore/home
 * UNO: https://www.unobookstore.com/
and purchase an access code.  
2. Do ***NOT*** go directly to the zyBooks website.  Instead,
***be sure to go through Canvas***.  Click on **Assignments** and
select the relevant **Module Reading**

Completing the readings through canvas will
automatically update your grade.  You do not need to complete a reading
all in one shot.  Your progress is saved and you can come back to a
reading as many times as you wish.  You just need to be sure to complete
the reading by the due date.

If you accessed zyBooks directly through the website and not through
canvas, you may need to *merge* the multiple accounts you created.
